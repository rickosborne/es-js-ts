# @rickosborne/css

Basic CSS utilities built on:

- [@rickosborne/typical](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rickosborne/typical) for types
- [@rickosborne/guard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rickosborne/guard) for guards
- [@rickosborne/foundation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rickosborne/foundation) for basic utilities

This is not, in any way, a general-purpose CSS handling library.
It includes some very happy-path-oriented utilities, primarily intended for when you have control over the input.

> ⚠️⚠️⚠️ ***This library does not attempt to cover the various edge cases of the real world or the CSS spec.*** ⚠️⚠️⚠️
